      "question": "What is the output of the following code snippet?",
      "code": "byte b = 10;\nb = (byte) (b + 10);\nSystem.out.println(b);",
      "options": [
        "20",
        "Compilation error",
        "Runtime error",
        "1010"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Adding two variables or a variable and a literal results in an int. Casting back to byte is necessary. Here it is done correctly, so it prints 20."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "What does this code print?",
      "code": "Integer i1 = 127;\nInteger i2 = 127;\nInteger i3 = 128;\nInteger i4 = 128;\nSystem.out.println((i1 == i2) + \" \" + (i3 == i4));",

        "true false",
        "false true"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Integer values between -128 and 127 are cached. i1 and i2 point to the same object, while i3 and i4 are new objects."
    },

      "id": 3,
      "question": "What is the result of the following String operation?",
      "code": "String s1 = \"Java\";\nString s2 = \"Ja\" + \"va\";\nString s3 = new String(\"Java\");\nSystem.out.println((s1 == s2) + \" \" + (s1 == s3.intern()));",

        "false true",
        "false false"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Compile-time constant expressions are interned. intern() returns the reference from the pool, so both comparisons are true."
    },

      "code": "double result = Math.floor(-2.1);",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Math.floor returns the largest integer less than or equal to the argument. For -2.1, -3.0 is the smaller integer."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "delete(2, 4) removes characters at index 2 and 3 ('23'). insert(2, 'XYZ') places the string starting at index 2."

        "345"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "substring(start, end) is inclusive of the start index and exclusive of the end index. Index 2 is '3', index 3 is '4'."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The literal \"apple\" is placed in the pool once. 'c' creates a new object on the heap, but it refers to the same pool literal string."

      "id": 13,
      "question": "What is the output of this code?",
      "code": "System.out.println(Math.ceil(-0.5));",

        "-0.0",
        "1.0"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Math.ceil returns the smallest integer value that is greater than or equal to the argument. -0.0 is equal to 0.0 but preserves the sign in some cases; ceiling of -0.5 is -0.0."

        "Compilation error"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "When performing math on char, it is promoted to an int. 'A' is 65, so 65 + 1 = 66."

        "8"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The text block includes the newline after 'abc' because the closing '\"\"\"' is on a new line. Thus: 'a', 'b', 'c', '\\n' = 4."
