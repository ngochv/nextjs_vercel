    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What is the output of the following code snippet?",
      "code": "byte a = 10;\nbyte b = 20;\nbyte c = a + b;\nSystem.out.println(c);",
      "options": [
        "30",
        "Compile-time error",
        "ClassCastException",
        "An arbitrary value due to overflow"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Arithmetic operations on byte, short, or char result in an int. The assignment back to byte 'c' requires an explicit cast."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "What does the following code print?",
      "code": "Integer x = 128;\nInteger y = 128;\nSystem.out.println(x == y);",
      "options": [
        "true",
        "false",
        "null",
        "Compile-time error"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Integer cache only covers values from -128 to 127. Values outside this range are created as new objects, so the '==' operator compares references and returns false."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "What is the result of Math.round(-1.5)?",
      "code": "System.out.println(Math.round(-1.5));",

        "-1",
        "-2",
        "-1.0",
        "-2.0"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Math.round adds 0.5 to the argument and takes the floor. -1.5 + 0.5 = -1.0. The floor of -1.0 is -1. Also, Math.round returns a long/int."
    },

        "22"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "When a StringBuilder is initialized with a String, its capacity is the String length plus the default 16 characters (3 + 16 = 19)."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "s1 points to an object on the heap created with 'new'. s2 points to the constant in the pool. Therefore, s1 == s2 is false."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "delete(2, 4) removes characters at index 2 and 3 ('2', '3'). insert(2, 'XYZ') puts 'XYZ' starting at index 2."

      "id": 12,
      "question": "In a Text Block, how is incidental whitespace determined?",
      "code": "",
      "options": [
        "By the position of the first character in the block",
        "By the position of the closing triple quotes",

        "Both B and C are used to determine indentation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The indentation is determined by the leftmost position of either a character in any line or the closing delimiter."

        "Compile-time error"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The '+' operator promotes the char 'A' (65) to an int. The result is 66. To get 'B', you would need to cast: (char)(c + 1)."
